This Python program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and NumPy to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple XOR operation with a specified key. The program includes functions for both encryption and decryption. The encrypt_image function takes an image file path and a key, converts the image to a NumPy array, and performs an XOR operation on each pixel value with the key to produce an encrypted image. The decrypt_image function reverses this process, taking an encrypted image and the same key to restore the original image. The main function provides an interactive command line interface, allowing users to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt an image, input the image file path, and specify the key. The program then displays the encrypted or decrypted image and allows the user to save it to a specified file path. This tool is useful for learning about basic image processing and encryption techniques in Python and can be run in any Python 3.x environment with PIL and NumPy installed.
